# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
***  

## About this repository 
 
This repository was created for the peer-graded assignment of: 

> Course 3: Getting And Cleaning Data, 
> from Data Science Specialization, 
> by Johns Hopkins University, 
> on coursera  

The course is taught by: 
 
  - Jeff Leek, Phd 
  - Roger D. Peng, Phd
  - Brian Caffo, Phd
 
The assignment required the following:

> You will be required to submit: 
> 
>   1. a tidy data set as described below 
>   2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing
       the analysis, and 
>   3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any
       transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
       called CodeBook.md. 
> 
> You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
> This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

and for the main script, 'run_analysis.R' the requirements was that it should
be able to run, as far as the 'UCI HAR Dataset' is present in the working
directory and to be able to perform the following 5 steps:

> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
each measurement. 
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
> 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
