# CODE BOOK for the 'tidy_data' data table. 

### Identificators and averages of features
 
The first 2 variables, 'subject' and 'activity',
can uniquely identify each row of the table. 
The remaining 66 variables stand for the averages of selected features - those containing information
on means and standard deviations - from the original dataset:
'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0'.
 
 
### Description of the variables from 'tidy_data'
 
The following table describes all variables of the 'tidy_data' table.

### How to load 'tidy_data' data in R 
 
In order to load the 'tidy_data' in R correctly,
use the following command:
 
``` 
tidy_data <- read.table(file = "./UCI HAR Dataset/tidydata.txt", header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE, dec = ".") 
``` 

``` 
   
### About 'tidy_data' table 

This dataset was created for the needs of: 

> Course 3: 'Getting and Cleaning Data', 
> from 'Data Science Specialization', 
> by 'Johns Hopkins University', 
> on Coursera 
>
> The course is taught by: 
>
>    - Jeff Leek, Phd 
>    - Roger D. Peng, Phd 
>    - Brian Caffo, Phd 
 
The data table can be reproduced,
as all required scripts are available on the Git Hub repository
https://github.com/thanos1925/assignment_week_4
Before trying to reproduce it,
the following notes should be taken into account:
 
  - The data used for the download was accessed at 2020-05-23 23:18:50 BST.
  - The data was then processed by the script 
    '[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/thanos1925/assignment_week_4/blob/master/run_analysis.R)'
    to create the 'tidy_data' table.
  - The scripts were executed in RStudio (version 1.2.5033)
  - The library 'dplyr' version 0.8.5 was used.
  - The output produced by 'R.version' is the following:
 
```

## The process by which the 'tidy_data' table was produced  

In order to produce the 'tidy_data' table,
the script 
'[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/thanos1925/assignment_week_4/blob/master/run_analysis.R)'
was created and used. 
It performs the following tasks: 
 
#### Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set with target variables. 
 
  1. Binds these files,
       - UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
       - UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
       - UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt.
      
     from the train set by columns to a table that contains,
     the human subject, the activity performed and the values of the features. 
  2. Binds these files,
       - UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
       - UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
       - UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt.
      
     from the test set by columns to a table that contains,
     the human subject, the activity performed and the values of the features. 
  3. Binds the data frames created for test and train set into one large dataset
     by rows.

#### Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 
  1. Finds the target features, which are the features with measurements
     about mean and standard deviation, and extracts them as well as those
     that indicate the 'subject' and 'activity_label' and creates a new data table
     only with the target variables. 
 
#### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.   

  1. Replace the variable about activity, that contains integers from 1 to 6,
     with a factor based on levels and labels contained in the 'activity_labels'
     data file. 
 
#### Appropriately labels the data set with target variables with descriptive names. 
 
  1. Extracts the target variable names from 'features.txt'.
  2. Creates a new tidy dataset with the appropriate labels for the variable
     names. 
 
#### From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


  1. Group the tidy data table created in step 4, by 'subject' and 'activity_label'. 
  2. Summarize each variable to find the average for the grouped values. 
  3. Ungroup the data table. 
  4. Add descriptive names to the variables of the new tidy data table,
     by adding the prefix 'Avrg-' in the names of the target feature averages.
  5. Write the data in a text file in the present working directory
    
***
## Description of the features on which the averages were based 
 
### Informations on how the features were produced from the raw data 
 
The selected features were produced, as it is explained in the
'features_info.txt' file of the original data set:
 
> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
>
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived
in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ).
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using
the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag).

### Informations on the collection of raw data 
 
The raw singals were produced, as it is explained in the 'README.txt' file of
original data set:
   
> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within
an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been
randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected
for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
>
>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of
2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal,
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using
a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity.
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components,
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window,
a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and
frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
> 
> #### For each record it is provided: 
> 
> - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration)
and the estimated body acceleration. 
> - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
> - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
> - Its activity label. 
> - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 
 
and also it include the following notes: 

> Notes: 
> 
> - Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. 
> - Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
